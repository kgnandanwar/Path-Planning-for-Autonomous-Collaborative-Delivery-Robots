# Path-Planning-for-Autonomous-Collaborative-Delivery-Robots

This project is a part of the graduate robotics course RBE 550 - Motion Planning. For this project, we implement a motion planning algorithm on a swarm of autonomous mobile manipulators for package delivery.

The project is performed on the following softwares:

## Pygame
Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library. This allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in the python language. Pygame is open source and highly portable and runs on nearly every platform and operating system.

## CoppeliaSim (VREP)
The robotics simulator CoppeliaSim, with integrated development environment, is based on a distributed control architecture: each object/model can be individually controlled via an embedded script, a plugin, a ROS node, a remote API client, or a custom solution. This makes CoppeliaSim very versatile and ideal for multi-robot applications. Controllers can be written in C/C++, Python, Java, Lua, Matlab or Octave.
